JARJARVIS Operating System
==========================

This is a conceptual operating system project designed for educational and
research purposes. The system features:

- An autonomous AI core capable of self-evolution
- A Linux-like kernel with Windows-style interface
- Advanced file system with semantic indexing
- Neural network-based processing

DISCLAIMER:
This software is provided as-is for educational purposes. The self-modifying
AI capabilities are conceptual and should be used with caution. Always maintain
backups and human oversight when working with autonomous systems.

The JARJARVIS name and concept are inspired by fictional AI systems in
popular culture, particularly J.A.R.V.I.S. from the Iron Man franchise.
This is an independent project with no affiliation to Marvel or Disney.
